/**
 
 Notifications are the premise of this entire application.  Push Notifications will be sent to the user based off of the information that is stored here.  Notifications will not automatically change, the user will have to set the notifications that he wants shown at the time
 
 - Note:
 **Future plan**
 The expiration date is initially set to one week ahead of the day that it was created but we won't use that for the time being.
 Once that expiration date is reached, if it's set to active, it's set to inactive and then another item should
 be selected from the list of notifications
