Spaced repetition provides an increase of 30% to your retention rate.  This application uses notifications to help you learn skills permanently and naturally.  How do we do this?\n\nWe help you to be consistent by sending you constistant reminders.  But, the reminders are not reminders for you to open the app, instead, whatever you want to remember is sent as a notification.  You can then read through those notifications from the Home Screen without having to open the app, which will help you because you can read through them quickly without having to open the app.";
