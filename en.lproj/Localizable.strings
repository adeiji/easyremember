This app can help you to learn a new skill, a new language, all kinds of things. How do we accomplish this?\n\nThe key to learning anything is repetition. Repetition is what makes a skill or knowledge become second nature. This application uses notifications to help you learn skills permanently and naturally. How do we do this?\n\nWe help you to be consistent by sending you regular reminders. But, the reminders are not reminders for you to open the app; instead, whatever you want to remember is sent as a notification. You can then read through those notifications from the Home Screen without having to open the app, which will help you because you can read through them quickly.\n\nOn the home page, you can also test yourself like using flashcards.";
